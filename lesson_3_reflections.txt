When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on different computers or when working with other contributors. Also
  as a way to have a master version saved that could be accessed by anyone or anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  you could be making changes locally and Git would over write those changes
  if you were working on the changes before you could push. Also if others had
  made changes you would want to review them before pulling them down.
