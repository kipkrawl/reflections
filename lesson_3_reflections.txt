When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When working on different computers or when working with other contributors. Also
  as a way to have a master version saved that could be accessed by anyone or anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  you could be making changes locally and Git would over write those changes
  if you were working on the changes before you could push. Also if others had
  made changes you would want to review them before pulling them down.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use
one instead of another?

  branches exist on your local repository. Use when expermenting or going a new
  direction

  clones are pulled down from GitHub or you could start a new clone on your
  local machine in a different directory. Use when taking someone elses work or
  starting someting new off of previos work you've done.

  forks are done on GitHub and is a way to get someone elses work and move to
  your GitHub repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

  You have a point in time that the local copy matched the remote copy. Now you
  can make changes to the local copy then, when ready, compare to the remote copy
  to understand conflicts before pushing, pulling or merging.
