What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  a "meta data" file is created to change changes made to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

  The staging are can hold multiple changes that can have different commits

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

  When trying new functionality or experimenting.
  Allow to have simultaneous version working in parralel without impactin each other

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

  The different branches can get complex very fast. Having a diagram of the
  branches will ensure that all commits are reachable and you dont "dead-end"
  any. The diagrams are critical to understand all branches as the git log
  command wont show everything if there is not a parent commit that was created.
