How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

  Made it easier to do the compare
  And find the difference

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term

  Being able to go back in time and start over or make modifications

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create
a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved like
Google Docs does?

  Pro: flexibility and logic in changes
  Con: if you forget or delay could cause issues

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

  When multiple files are involved in the code execution you need to know what
  changes have been made to all the files.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

  git log shows the history of the changes
  git diff shows the differences between the changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

  You could always just go back to the previous version easily, but using
  "git checkout" to set the current version

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

  To enable version control when working with Python in the Machine learning
  class.
